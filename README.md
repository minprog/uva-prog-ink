Introduction to programming for Information Scientists
======================================================

This is the mini-course in programming for first year students of Information
Science at the University of Amsterdam. It is a fast paced course. Every first
day contains a little bit of theory, small exercises and a few larger exercises
for more experienced students. The last problem set is a larger project
designed to be completed in two weeks.

The course is mostly based on MIT's 6.189 and 6.00, both of which are available
at http://ocw.mit.edu/
