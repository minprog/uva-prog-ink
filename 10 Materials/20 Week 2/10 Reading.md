# Welcome to week 2!

This week you'll learn about:

* debugging;
* functions and methods;
* returning values;
* `math`;
* plotting; and
* lists.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always 
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want 
to re-read them after this practice session!
