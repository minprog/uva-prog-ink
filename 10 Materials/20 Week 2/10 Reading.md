# Welcome to week 2!

Today, you'll learn about:

* debugging;
* functions and methods;
* returning values;
* `math`;
* plotting; and
* lists.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always 
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want 
to re-read them after this practice session!

## Readings

From [*How to think like a computer scientist* (Allen Downey)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

* [10.1-10.6 Lists](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython011.html)
* [3. Functions](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython004.html)
* [A. Debugging](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython021.html)
* [10.12-10.13 Lists with functions](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython011.html)
* [6.5-6.9 Encapsulation](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap06.html)

## Lecture

The lecture contains:

* a short live coding session of the prime finder;
* making the prime finder into a function;
* testing the prime finder with a few test cases;
* a bit of math in the Python Shell;
* graphs in the Python Shell.

## What to turn in

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source code 
files that we can test, and optionally one or two `.py` files for the Hacker 
edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is today, by 18:00. However, you are required to review your 
exercises with an assistant before 16:30.
