In this week you'll finish the remaining features of the game. In case you took
any shortcuts for the beta you should implement a proper solution for those
features. Thoroughly test your game and spend the remaining time to implement
any expansions.

The remaining requirements are:

* Prevent illegal moves.
* Read a starting state from file like [this one](hanoi.txt). Each line is a
  tower and larger numbers represent larger discs.

Possible hacker expansions are:

* Add an undo button --- Undo all the way to the starting position
* Implement an iterative solution option as described
  [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Iterative_solution).
* Allow for a varying number of towers/discs
* Make the discs draggable
