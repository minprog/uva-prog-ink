Here is what you need to do in the coming weeks:

* In the **First lab session** (Monday) you install Pygame, and you will do the
  Pygame tutorial. This should not take more than 2 hours. If it takes longer,
  you need to finish today's work at home!

  See the [*Linux*](/project/linux) page for more information on using Linux on
  the faculty computers.

  After doing that tutorial, you should have somewhat of an understanding how
  Pygame games work: there are global variables that contain the game elements,
  and there is a main game loop that will handle all interactions from the user.

  You need to use this knowledge to create your design document. Head to the
  [*Design Document*](/project/design-document) page to see what you need to
  deliver.

* At the **end of the first week**, you will have finished a beta version of
  your game. See the [*Beta Version*](/project/beta-version) page for the
  requirements.

* At the **end of the first week**, you will have finished a beta version of
  your game. See the [*Final Version*](/project/final-version) page for the
  requirements.
