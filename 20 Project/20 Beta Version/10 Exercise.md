After you have finished your design document you should work on your beta
version. For this version you should focus on delivering on implementing all
features, but you are allowed to take shortcuts; the game doesn't have to behave
correctly in all situations. Implement each feature in the most simple way you
can think of and then move on to the next. The following features are required
for the beta.

* Graphically represent any state in the Towers of Hanoi game.
* Move discs between towers using the mouse.
* Detect when the game is solved.

For this version you should make it a priority to implement all required
features rather than implementing some features perfectly.

**Submit the beta version at the end of week and discuss it with a lab assistant
  on friday or monday.**
