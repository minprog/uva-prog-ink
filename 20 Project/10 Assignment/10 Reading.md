# Welcome to week 6!

This week you'll learn about;

* file input/output
* drawing graphics using Pygame

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want
to re-read them after this practice session!

## Readings

From [*Making Games with Python and Pygame* (Al Sweigart)](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/).

* [Pygame Basics](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter2.html) (Until the Animation paragraph)
* [Pygame.event Reference](http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html) (The list of possible event types and their attributes)
