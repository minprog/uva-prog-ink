# Towers of Hanoi in Pygame

The idea of this exercise is to graphically implement Towers of Hanoi. Make
sure you have read the Pygame basics and have practiced with making some shapes
before getting started.

## Required features

* Graphically represent any state in the Towers of Hanoi game
* Move discs between towers using the mouse
* Prevent illegal moves
* Detect when the game is solved
* Read a starting state from file like [this one](hanoi.txt). Each line is a
  tower and larger numbers represent larger discs.

## Expectations

* First lab session: write your design document
* First week: finish the [Beta Version](/project/beta-version)
* Second week: finish the [Final Version](/project/final-version)
