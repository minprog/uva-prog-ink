The idea of this exercise is to graphically implement the *Tower of Hanoi*
puzzle. For a description of the puzzle we refer to [Wikipedia]. Make sure you
have read the Pygame basics and practiced with drawing some shapes before
getting started.

**You will work in the same pairs as last two weeks, unless we made other
arrangements!**

## Required features

Here are the features that your game should provide for the user!

* Graphically represent any state in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
* Move discs between towers using the mouse.
* Prevent illegal moves.
* Detect when the game is solved.
* Read a starting state from file like [this one](hanoi.txt). Each line is a
  tower and larger numbers represent larger discs.
