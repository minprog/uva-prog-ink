# Towers of Hanoi in Pygame

The idea of this exercise is to graphically implement Towers of Hanoi. Make
sure you have read the Pygame basics and have practiced with making some shapes
before getting started.

## Required features

* Graphically represent any state in the Towers of Hanoi game
* Move discs between towers using the mouse
* Prevent illegal moves
* Detect when the game is solved
* Read a starting state from file like [this one](hanoi.txt). Each line is a tower and larger numbers represent larger discs.

## Possible expansions

* Add a move counter
* Add an undo button --- Undo all the way to the starting position
* Implement an iterative solution option as described [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#Iterative_solution).
* Allow for a varying number of towers/discs
* Make the discs draggable
