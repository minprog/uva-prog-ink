During the first lab session of the project you should write a technical design
document. This document should contain at least the following:

* a description of the graphical elements that should appear on screen (draw
  all elements in their initial position; do it on paper and photograph it);

* a description of all events in the game and how these are handled (what
  happens if the user...);

* the algorithm or formula that determines if the game is won;

* a description of the main game loop (have another look at the game loops in
  the Pygame tutorial; what elements are in there?);

* and finally, a plan of which features can be made this week, and which
  features can be made next week.

The document should be one file containing all elements and including any
photographs you made.

**Submit the design document and discuss it with a lab assistant during the
first lab session this week.**

After doing this, you can start coding!
