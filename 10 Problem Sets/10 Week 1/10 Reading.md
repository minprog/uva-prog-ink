# The first week

This *Python Practice* section will be your first day of Python
programming. Today, you'll learn about communicating with the user, strings,
loops and if statements.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want to
re-read them over the weekend.

## Readings

From Think Python, read chapters:

* 1 The way of the program
* 2 Variables, expressions and statements
* 5.1 -- 5.7 Conditionals
* 7.1 -- 7.4 Iteration
