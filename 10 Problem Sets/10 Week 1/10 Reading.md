# The first week

This *Python Practice* section will be your first day of Python programming.
Today, you'll learn about communicating with the user, and about strings, loops
and `if` statements.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want to
re-read during the week.

## Homework

From Think Python, read chapters:

* 1 The way of the program
* 2 Variables, expressions and statements
* 5.1 -- 5.7 Conditionals
* 7.1 -- 7.4 Iteration

You are required to mark all sections that you find hard to understand. You
must also write down any questions that pop up during reading.

You must bring the syllabus to the lecture. We will check what you have read
and talk to you about the questions you have.
