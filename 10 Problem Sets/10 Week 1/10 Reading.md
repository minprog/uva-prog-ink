# The first week

This *Python Practice* section will be your first day of Python programming. Today, you'll learn about communicating with the user, strings, loops and if statements.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want to re-read them over the weekend.
