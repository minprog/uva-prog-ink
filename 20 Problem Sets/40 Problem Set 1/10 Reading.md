# Welcome to week 4!

This week you'll learn more about strings; and you're going to write larger
programs.

Please prepare using the readings below. They will not always immediately make
sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want to re-read them
during the week!

## Readings

From Think Python, read chapter:

* 8.5 -- 8.11 More strings
* 11 Dictionaries
