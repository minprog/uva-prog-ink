These exercises will take you on a trip through Python. You are supposed to try
out the code in your Python interpreter as often as possible.

# Exercise 1.0 – Installing Python

Follow the instructions on installing Python and IDLE in the [Reference]
section. Be sure to install Python version 2.7.x! Ask an assistant for help if
you run into any trouble. Before continuing, play around with the Python shell
a bit and explore how you can use it as a calculator.

# Exercise 1.1 – Hello, world!

Recall that a program is just a set of instructions for the computer to
execute. Let's start with a basic command `print x` which prints the value of
the expression `x`, followed by a *newline*.

Create a new program called `hello_world.py`. You will use this file to write
your very first 'Hello, world!' program. How to create a program file:

1. Open a new window by choosing **New Window** from the **File** menu.

	![File -> New](file-new.png)

2. Save the file as `hello_world.py`. Do NOT skip the `.py` portion of the file
name --- otherwise, you will lose out on syntax highlighting!

	![Filename](filename.png)

3. Start every program with a bank of comments, with a comment line for your
name, the name of your file, the day of the week, and today's date. Recall that
a comment line begins with a `#` (pound) symbol.

You can now write your very own *Hello, world!* program. This is the first
program that most programmers write in a new programming language. In Python,
*Hello world!* is a very simple program to write. Do this now... it should be
only be one line!

When you are done, save your work and run it. Your code should look similar to
this:

![Hello World example](hello-world.png)

To run your program, chose **Run Module** from the **Run** menu (or just hit F5
on Windows/Linux, or fn-F5 on a Mac). When you run the code, your shell should
look similar to this:

![Shell Hello World](shell.png)

When you run your code, it first prints the line `>>> ===== RESTART =====`, then
runs your code underneath that line. See?

# Exercise 1.2 – Printing

From the course website, download the [homework1.py](homework1.py)
template. Remember to put your name and section at the top. If you don't we'll
be highly grumpy.

Write a program using print that, when run, prints out a tic-tac-toe
board. Remember to save your program regularly, to keep from losing your work!
The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you understand how to write
programs using your computing environment; many students in introductory courses
experience trouble with assignments not because they have trouble with the
material, but because of some weird environment quirk.

Expected output:

	  |  |
	--------
	  |  |
	--------
	  |  |

# Exercise 1.3 – Variables

Recall that variables are containers for storing information. For example,

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	a = "Hello, world!"
	print a

Output:

	Hello, world!

The `=` sign is an assignment operator which tells the interpreter to assign the
value `"Hello, world!"` to the variable `a`.

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	a = "Hello, world!"
	a = "and goodbye..."
	print a
		
Output:

	and goodbye...
		
Taking this second example, the value of a after executing the first line above
is `"Hello, world!"`. But, after executing the second line, the value of a
changes to `"and goodbye..."`. Since we ask the program to print out a only
after the second assignment statement, that is the value that gets printed. If
you wanted to save the values of both strings, you should change the second
variable to another valid variable name, such as `b`.

Variables are useful because they can cut down on the amount of code you have to
write. In your own `homework1.py`, write a program that prints out the
tic-tac-toe board from exercise 1.2, but which uses variables to cut down on the
amount of typing you have to do. **Hint**: how many different variables should
you need?

# Exercise 1.4 – Operators/Order of Operation

Python has the ability to be used as a cheap, 5-dollar calculator. In
particular, it supports basic mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as well
as the power operator `**` and the modulus operator `%`.

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	x = 5 + 7
	print x
	y = x + 10
	print y

Output:

	12
	22

Note that we can use variables in the definition of other variables!
Mathematical operators only work on numbers: `int`s or `float`s. Statements such
as `'Hi' + 5` or `'5 + 7` will not work.

**Part I**: Input the following sets of equations, and note the difference
  between `int` arithmetic and `float` arithmetic. You can do this just in your
  interpreter (you don't need to turn anything in for this part), but pay
  attention to the output!
	
1.	$$5/2$$, $$5/2.0$$, and $$5.0/2$$

	Note that as long as one argument is a float, all of your math 
	will be floating point!

2.	$$7 xx (1 / 2)$$ and $$7 xx (1 / 2.0)$$

3.	$$5^2$$, $$5.0^2$$, $$5^2.0$$

4.	$$1/3.0$$

	Note that the final digit is rounded. Python does this for non-terminating
	decimal numbers (Don't know what these are? Ask!), as computers cannot 
	store infinite numbers!

**Part II**: In `homework1.py`, transcribe the following equations into Python
  (without simplifying!), preserving order of operation with parenthesis as
  needed. Save each as the value of a variable, and then print the variable.

1.	$$(3 xx 5) / (2 + 3)$$

2.	$$sqrt(7 + 9) xx 2$$

3.	$$(4 - 7) ^ 3$$

4.	$$root4(-19+100)$$

5.	$$6 mod 4$$

	If you aren't familiar with modular arithmetic, it is pretty
	straightforward: the modulus operator, in the expression $$x mod y$$, gives
	the remainder when $$x$$ is divided by $$y$$. Try a couple of modular
	expressions until you get the hang of it.

**Part III**: In `homework1.py`, use order of operation mathematics to create
  two equations that look the same (i.e., have the same numbers) but evaluate to
  different values (due to parenthesization). Save each as the value of a
  variable, then print the variables.

# Exercise 1.5 – User input

Do this exercise in `homework1.py`. In this exercise, we will ask the user for
his/her first and last name, and date of birth, and print them out
formatted. Recall that you can get input from the user using the command
`raw_input("text")`, as shown in lecture.

**Note**: There are two functions to get user input. The first, `raw_input`,
  turns whatever the user inputs into a `string` automatically. The second,
  `input`, preserves type. So, if the user inputs an `int`, or a `float`, you
  will get an `int` or a `float` (rather than a `string`). Be careful though:
  you still want to use raw input if you want a string back, or otherwise the
  user will have to put quotes around their answer. Use raw input here: it's
  good for string processing, like this problem. `input` will come in handy when
  using user input to compute math, like in Exercise 1.8.

Here is an example of what this program should do:

	Enter your first name: Chuck
	Enter your last name: Norris
	Enter your date of birth:
	Month? March
	Day? 10
	Year? 1940
	Chuck Norris was born on March 10, 1940.
		
To print a string and a number in one line, you just need to separate the
arguments with a comma (this works for any two types within a print
statement). The comma adds a space between the two arguments. For example, the
lines:

{: .language-python}
	mo = 'October'
	day = '20'
	year = '1977'
	print mo, day, year

will have the output

	October 20 1977

## Pretty printing

**Optional**: Now, for something completely different... a discussion on how to
  print strings, most prettily...

Note that none of the commas are in this output! To do that you want something
like this:

{: .language-python}
	print mo, day + ',', year

The `+` sign concatenates two strings, but can only be used on two
strings. Using it on a number and a string will cause an error (because it is
ambiguous as to what you want the program to do!)

That's why it's a great idea to use raw_input for this problem; if you use input
you'd have to convert the `int` to a `string`. We'll cover this more in-depth
later on, when we get to strings, but you may want to play with string
concatenation operations now to get everything to look its prettiest.

# Intermezzo: Questions

At this point, we suggest completing questions 1.9--1.11 to cement your
understanding of these topics. Just go to the next tab, answer the questions
and return here to code some more.

# Exercise 1.6 – New Operators

Open up IDLE and play around with the operators from the book (look them up in
the index). Make sure that you understand how to use them and what they are
used for! The operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` are called *relation*
operators.

They work on all types, not just numbers, and return a `Boolean`
(`True`/`False`) value. Remember, if you are using `Boolean`s, to capitalize
`True` and `False`! Here's an example shell session; try other examples you can
think of.

	>>> 5 >= 7
	False
	>>> 'abc' != 'def'
	True
	>>> x = 'abc'
	>>> x == 'abc'
	True

This next example is strange! Try to understand what’s going on here, and ask if
you’re confused.

	>>> a = True
	>>> b = (5 < 7)
	>>> a == b
	True

Next, the operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` change the value of a stored variable
in a quicker way. In the following example, we add 6 to a variable in two
different ways; note that we get the same result! Try using all of these
operators in your interpreter window before moving on.

	>>> x = 5
	>>> x = x + 6
	>>> print x
	11
	>>> y = 5
	>>> y += 6
	>>> print y
	11

# Intermezzo: Questions

We strongly suggest you finish all questions now, before continuing on with the
next exercise.

# Exercise 1.7 – Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this exercise, you are going to practice using conditionals (`if`, `elif`,
`else`). You will write a small program that will determine the result of a
"rock, paper, scissors" game, given Player 1 and Player 2's choices. Your
program will print out the result. Here are the rules of the game:

![Rock, paper, scissors](rock.png)

1. First create a truth table for all the possible choices for player 1 and 2,
and the outcome of the game. This will help you figure out how to code the game!

   **Protip**: you can fill out the table below in your browser. If you are
     logged in to the website, your answers will be saved and remembered until
     the next time you login.

	|Player 1      |Player 2      |Result        |
	|--------------|--------------|--------------|
	|Rock          |Rock          |Tie           |
	|Rock          |Scissors      |Player 1      |
	|<input name="a[1-7-1]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-2]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-3]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-4]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-5]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-6]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-7]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-8]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-9]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-10]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-11]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-12]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-13]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-14]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-15]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-16]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-17]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-18]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-19]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-20]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-21]" type="text">|

2. Create a new file `rps.py` that will generate the outcome of the rock,
scissors, paper game. The program should ask the user for input and display the
answer as follows:

		Player 1? rock
		Player 2? scissors
		Player 1 wins.

The only valid inputs are `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. If the user enters
anything else, your program should output "This is not a valid object
selection". Use the truth table you created to help with creating the conditions
for your if statement(s).

**Note**: If you have a long condition in your `if` statement, and you want to
  split it into multiple lines, you can either enclose the entire expression in
  parenthesis, e.g.

{: .language-python}
	if (player1 == 'rock' and
		player2 == 'scissors'):
		print 'Player 1 wins.'

Or, you can use the *backslash* symbol to indicate to Python that the next line
is still part of the previous line of code, e.g.

{: .language-python}
	if player1 == 'rock' and\
		player2 == 'scissors':
		print 'Player 1 wins.'

Use whichever form you feel comfortable using.

# Exercise 1.8 – For & While Loops

Create a new file called `loops.py` and use it for all parts of this
exercise. Remember the difference between input and raw input? If not, look at
Exercise 1.5 again.

Be sure to test your code for each part before moving on to the next part.

1. Using a for loop, write a program that prints out the decimal equivalents of
$$1 / 2, 1/3, 1 / 4, ..., 1/10$$.

2. Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and
prints a countdown from that number to zero. What should your program do if the
user inputs a negative number? As a programmer, you should always consider "edge
conditions" like these when you program! (Another way to put it: always assume
the users of your program will be trying to find a way to break it! If you don't
include a condition that catches negative numbers, what will your program do?)

3. Write a program using a for loop that calculates exponentials. Your program
should ask the user for a base `base` and an exponent `exp`, and calculate
`base`<sup>`exp`</sup>. You can't use the `^` operator!

4. Write a program using a while loop that asks the user to enter a number that
is divisible by 2. Give the user a witty message if they enter something that is
not divisible by 2, *and make them enter a new number*. Don't let them stop
until they enter an even number! Print a congratulatory message when they
*finally* get it right.
