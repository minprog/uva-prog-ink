# Programs

Here are two programs that you will write from scratch, in order to practice
for weeks 4 and on, where you'll be writing larger programs all the time.

## Zeller's Algorithm

Zeller's algorithm computes the day of the week on which a given date will fall
(or fell). In this exercise, you will write a program to run Zeller's algorithm
on a specific date. You will need to create a new file for this program,
`zellers.py`. The program should use the algorithm outlined below to compute the
day of the week on which the user's birthday fell in the year you were born and
print the result to the screen.

Start with the program in Exercise 1.5, but ask for the month as a number
between 1-12 where March is 1 and February is 12. If born in Jan or Feb, enter
previous year (see the notes below). In the end, print out the name of the user
and on what they of the week they were born.

Zeller's algorithm is defined as follows:

Let A, B, C, D denote integer variables that have the following values:

* `A` = the month of the year, with March having the value 1, April the value 2,
  ..., December the value 10, and January and February being counted as months
  11 and 12 of the preceding year (in which case,subtract 1 from C)
* `B` = the day of the month (1, 2, 3, . . . , 30, 31)
* `C` = the year of the century (e.g. C = 89 for the year 1989)
* `D` = the century (e.g. D = 19 for the year 1989)

Note: if the month is January or February, then the preceding year is used for
computation. This is because there was a period in history when March 1st, not
January 1st, was the beginning of the year.

Let W, X, Y, Z, R also denote integer variables. Compute their values in the
following order using integer arithmetic:

* `W = (13 * A - 1) / 5`
* `X = C / 4`
* `Y = D / 4`
* `Z = W + X + Y + B + C - 2 * D`
* `R = the remainder when Z is divided by 7`
	
The value of R is the day of the week, where 0 represents Sunday, 1 is Monday,
..., 6 is Saturday. If the computed value of R is a negative number, add 7 to
get a non negative number between 0 and 6 (you don't need to do this in the
code). Print out R. You can check to be sure your code is working by looking at
[timeanddate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/).

Run some test cases: try today's date, your birth date, and whatever else
interests you! Feel free to submit your `zellers.py` code if you wish, we'll
certainly take a look at it if you do.

## Secret Messages

This exercise is tricky! Be sure to ask the assistants for help whenever you
need it!

The goal of this exercise is to write a cyclic cipher to encrypt messages. This
type of cipher was used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals. It is
very simple to generate but it can actually be easily broken and does not
provide the security one would hope for.

The key idea behind the Caesar cipher is to replace each letter by a letter some
fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if we want to create a
cipher shifting by 3, you will get the following mapping:

Plain:   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  
Cipher:  DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

To be able to generate the cipher above, we need to understand a little bit
about how text is represented inside the computer. Each character has a
numerical value and one of the standard encodings is ASCII (American Standard
Code for Information Interchange). It is a mapping between the numerical value
and the character graphic. For example, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and the
ASCII value of 'a' is 97. To convert between the ASCII code and the character
value in Python, you can use the following code:

{: .language-python}
	letter = 'a'

	# converts a letter to ascii code
	ascii_code = ord(letter)

	# converts ascii code to a letter
	letter_res = chr(ascii_code)
	
	print ascii_code, letter_res

Start small. Do not try to implement the entire program at once. Break the
program into parts as follows:

1.	Create a file called `cipher.py`. Start your program by asking the user
	for a phrase to encode and the shift value. Then begin the structure of
	your program by entering in this loop (we'll build on it more in a bit):

	{: .language-python}
		encoded_phrase = ''
		for c in phrase:
			encoded_phrase = encoded_phrase + c

	What does this loop do? Make sure you understand what the code does before
	moving on!

2.	Now modify the program above to replace all the alphabetic characters with
	'x'. For example:

		Enter sentence to encrypt: Mayday! Mayday!
		Enter shift value: 4
		The encoded phrase is:  Xxxxxx! Xxxxxx!

	We are going to apply the cipher only to the alphabetic characters and we
	will ignore the others.

3.	Now modify your code, so that it produces the encoded string using the
	cyclic cipher with the shift value entered by the user. Let's see how one
	might do a cyclic shift. Let's say we have the sequence:

		012345

	If we use a shift value of 4 and just shift all the numbers, the result
	will be:

		456789

	We want the values of the numbers to remain between `0` and `5`. To do
	this we will use the modulus operator. The expression `x % y` will return
	a number in the range `0` to `y - 1` inclusive, e.g. `4 % 6 = 4`,
	`6 % 6 = 0`, `7 % 6 = 1`. Thus the result of the operation will be:

		450123
		
	**Hint**: Note that the ASCII value of `A` is `65` and `a` is `97`, not
	`0`. So you will have to think how to use the modulus operator to achieve
	the desired result. Apply the cipher separately to the upper and lower
	case letters.
	
Here is what you program should output:

	Enter sentence to encrypt: Mayday! Mayday!
	Enter shift value: 4
	The encoded phrase is:  Qechec! Qechec!
