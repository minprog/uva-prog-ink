# The first week

This workshop will guide your first week of Python programming. You'll learn
about communicating with the user, and about strings, loops and `if` statements.

Prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always immediately
make sense without practice, but that's no problem. Re-read them during the
week, and you will start to see the light.

## Homework

From Think Python, read chapters:

* [1. The way of the program](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython002.html)
* [2. Variables, expressions and statements](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython003.html)
* [5.1--5.7 Conditionals](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython006.html)
* [7.1--7.4 Iteration](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython008.html)

You should write down any questions that pop up during reading. We will check
what you have read and talk to you about the questions you have.
