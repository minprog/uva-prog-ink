UNIX
: In the early days (70's/80's), UNIX was an operating system. But nowadays the term is used to describe an underlying philosophy on how to design (parts of) an operating system. Mac OS X and Linux seem to follow this philosophy. Windows does not.

Shell
: a shell is the underlying engine behind a command window. In practical terms, this means that every shell treats commands differently. Try to type `ls` in linux or in the command promt of Windows and see what happens.

Interpreter
: a program that translates code line by line to executable instructions for the computer. Python uses an interpreter. See Chapter 1 of the book for a more specific explanation.

Instruction
: examples of instructions are: getting data, displaying data or performing a basic mathematical operation. See Chapter 1 of the book for a more in-depth explanation.

Execute
: When something gets executed by a computer it means the program is running, and the user can interact with it or see the results when execution is complete.

Newline
: When a newline is entered, then output will be at the next line. The enter button produces newlines. The newline symbol is invisible, but sometimes you have to type it into your program. The symbol is denoted as `\n`.

Syntax Highlighting
: the structure of a program highlighted.

Printing
: the same thing as a print-statement.

Modulus operator
: An operator, denoted with a percent sign (`%`), that works on integers and yields the remainder when one number is divided by another. Tip: type in a few modulo calculations in a calculator and try to predict the result.

Functions
: A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. 

Concatenation
: to join two operands end-to-end. For example, if string1 is `"Mouse"` and string2 is `"Trap"`, then a concatenation could be `"Mouse Trap"` or `"TrapMouse"`.

Variable types
: A category of values. The types you have probably seen so far are integers (type `int`), floating-point numbers (type `float`), and strings (type `str`).

ASCII
: Joel Spolsky is able to explain this better than we do. Read <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html>

Algorithm
: a general process for solving a category of problems. Generally it can be seen as a series of steps. So in a sense, we perform algorithms in our daily lives all the time. The difference is that we don't know how to teach a computer such things (yet).
