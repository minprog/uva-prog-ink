## Installation with VMware Player on Windows

Installing VMware Player:

* Download VMware Player for free from http://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer/.

* Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your Downloads folder) in order launch VMware Player’s installer.

* If a window entitled User Account Control appears, click Yes.

* A window entitled VMware Player Setup should appear. Click Next.

* When prompted to select a Destination Folder, click Next.

* When prompted about Shortcuts, click Next. (Uncheck Desktop and/or Start Menu Programs folder if you’d like.)

* When prompted to Perform the Requested Operations, click Continue.

* Once you see Setup Wizard Complete, click Restart Now if prompted, else Continue.

Download the CS50 Appliance itself at (tbd). That file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.

Launch VMware Player, as by double-clicking its icon, which should be in your Applications folder. If prompted with a Software License Agreement, click Agree. If prompted for Licensing, paste in your license key, then click OK. If prompted to Create New, Convert VM, or Migrate PC, simply click Skip. If you do not yet have a license key, begin the trial. You may need to input an email address to proceed.

Select File &rarr; **Open...**. Navigate your way to that appliance50-19-vmware.ova and click Open.

Click VMware Player’s ▶ button to start up the appliance. If prompted to "upgrade this virtual machine," click Upgrade.

The appliance should then boot! If you see a black-and-white screen entitled GNU GRUB, no need to do anything; the appliance will continue to boot after a few seconds!
